imelly|Didn't know this was a political channel. WTF, you don't have sites where you can vomit that garbage out for the peanut gallery? Not everyone holds your same position. Why do that? Don't assume everyone is a socialist. Knock it off. I didn't join here to listen to your political BS. I am not paying a subscription to listen to you people pontificate about your political hangups with normal people. Unsubscribed, unfollowed. -iMellyGurl
